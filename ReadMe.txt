Zone Mount add-on for World of Warcraft
====================================

Zone Mount provides a way to summon a suitable mount, preferably one from the zone or region you are in.

You may have collected a lot of mounts, but if you never remember to use them, you are missing out on some fun content. Maybe you always use a mount from among the same few, or maybe a mount just doesn't fit in with where you are.

Zone Mount checks all your mounts and tries to summon a mount that is native to your current zone. If you have no mounts or only a few mounts from the zone, you may see a random mount instead.

If you want to summon a particular mount, Zone Mount can search your mounts for a mount matching the name you enter.


Usage:
=====

Use the Slash Commands listed below to operate Zone Mount or enter '/zm' in the Chat window to see a list of these commands.

Type '/zm macro' in the Chat to create a macro and stick its button to your mouse so you can place it into your action bar. This is the best way to use Zone Mount. The macro button will mount or dismount, but unlike Blizzard's "Summon Favorite Mount" button, it will not dismount you from a flying mount when you are hundreds of feet in the air! If it is not possible to mount at a particular time, the Chat will show you the reason for this.

If you really do want to plummet out of the sky, click the macro button twice inside 2 seconds.

Read the mount's name and description in the Chat. These descriptions can be very funny - yet another way we are missing out on some good content.


Slash Commands:
==============

- /zm mount - mount or dismount.
- /zm about - show info about your current mount.
- /zm __name__ - search for a mount by name (searching is case-insensitive and will find partial matches).
- /zm macro - create a macro for easy use of Zone Mount.
